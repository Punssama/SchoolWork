# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,4]\n[1,3,4]'
#
# You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
#
# Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing
# together the nodes of the first two lists.
#
# Return the head of the merged linked list.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
# Output: []
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
#
